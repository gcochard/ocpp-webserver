OCPP-Webserver
==============

This is a minimal viable product to expose an OCPP server via an http rest-like API.

## Pre-requisites
This was written on and is known to work on node.js ^18.16.1.

## Installing
1. Clone the repo
2. run `npm install`

## Running the server
1. run `npm start`

## Contributing
Contributions welcome but this is a hobby project built to determine whether chargelab or my EVSE was causing issues with intermittent charging.
